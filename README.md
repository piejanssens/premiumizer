# Premiumizer

Premiumizer is a download management tool for premiumize.me cloud downloads.

  - Web interface to manage premiumize.me cloud downloads
  - Category based automatic downloader of finished cloud tasks to local file system

  - Integrates with nzbToMedia (post processing)

## About premiumize.me
Premiumize.me combines anonymous cloud torrent downloads, usenet and premium hosters in one subscription. Cloud torrent downloads are cached, meaning if some other premiumize.me member downloaded the torrent through premiumize.me before, you can immediately download the files from that torrent over HTTPS at top speeds.

More info and get your account [right here](https://www.premiumize.me/ref/198754075).

## How does this thing work?
This tool will monitor your download tasks on premiumize.me.
Once the download in the cloud finishes and the download task has a category that needs to be automatically downloaded premiumizer will start downloading all the files to your local premiumizer server. Download tasks without a category will not be automatically downloaded to the local server. 
You can add/change a category whilst it's downloading through the web interface, but third party tools like CouchPotato and SickRage will automatically submit download tasks with a specific category. 

When enabled, premiumizer can inform nzbToMedia whenever the local download is finished.
Categories can be setup through the web interface's setup page.

## Web Interface
By default, premiumizer's web interface listens on port 5000.
When premiumizer is running you can access it at http://127.0.0.1:5000/ 
If premiumizer is running on a different PC replace Bind ip in settings with that computer's IP.

Support for reverse proxy (http only):
nginx example:
```
...
##PREMIUMIZER
    location /premiumizer {
        proxy_pass http://'ip':port;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Scheme $scheme;
        proxy_set_header X-Script-Name /premiumizer;

    }

    location /socket.io {
        proxy_pass http://'ip'/socket.io;
        proxy_redirect off;
        proxy_buffering off;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
